# Hafez-Horoscope
Themes of his ghazals include the beloved, faith, and exposing hypocrisy. In his ghazals he deals with love, wine and taverns, all presenting ecstasy and freedom from restraint, whether in actual worldly release or in the voice of the lover[8] speaking of divine love.[9][self-published source] His influence on Persian speakers appears in "Hafez readings" (fāl-e hāfez, Persian: فال حافظ‎) and in the frequent use of his poems in Persian traditional music, visual art, and Persian calligraphy. His tomb is visited often. Adaptations, imitations and translations of his poems exist in all major languages.   Read More About Hafez Poems: http://www.alamto.com/hafez/hafiz-poetry-art
